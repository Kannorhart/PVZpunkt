## Key Results

The simulation demonstrates that implementing self-service terminals combined with intelligent order distribution (bee algorithm) achieves:

- **43% reduction** in average waiting time
- **63% increase** in customer throughput
- **29% reduction** in resource utilization (improving from 92% to 65%)
- **Positive ROI** with payback period of 4-6 months

## Implementation Recommendations

1. Deploy 2-3 self-service terminals at high-traffic PVZ locations
2. Implement bee algorithm for dynamic order distribution
3. Train staff on new workflows and customer assistance
4. Monitor performance and adjust parameters based on real-world data

## Business Impact

- Annual labor savings of approximately 500,000 rubles
- 30% increase in service capacity
- Enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty
- Competitive advantage through faster service
