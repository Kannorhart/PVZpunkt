# PVZ Optimization During Peak Hours
## Technical Task Solution Presentation

---

## Problem Statement

During peak hours (18:00-20:00), order pickup points (PVZ) experience:
- Long queues and waiting times
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Overworked staff

**Objective**: Optimize PVZ operations to reduce waiting times by 25-35%

---

## Technological Process Model

### Process Components
1. **Customer Arrival** - Stochastic process
2. **Queue Formation** - FIFO principles
3. **Order Processing** - Employee-assisted service
4. **Customer Departure** - Service completion

### Stochastic Elements
- **Arrival Intervals**: Exponential distribution (λ=1 customer/minute)
- **Service Times**: Normal distribution (μ=2 min, σ=0.5 min)
- **Service Delays**: Uniform distribution (10% probability, 1-5 min)
